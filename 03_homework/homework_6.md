**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

SQL queries mainly focus on extracting and manipulating data efficiently. However, ethical and inequity components are crucial for a responsible data analysis. 
A fundamental principle involves protecting the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive data. Whenever possible, anonymizing such data before analysis ensures compliance with data privacy regulations. Best practices dictate analyzing how various groups are affected by the data. It's crucial to assess and potentially restructure queries to promote inclusivity within the analysis.
The initial step towards ethical and inequity query writing involves source review. This entails verifying whether the data was collected fairly and representatively and identifying any biases within the data collection process. Unequal data distribution can be identified using aggregation in SQL. If significant skewness exists, filtering out outliers may help to reduce the distribution's skewness. Additionally, using median and percentile instead of average function reduces the influence of outliers.
When using SQL for reporting purposes, use of filtered views by demographic factors and use of aggregated data, mitigate the bias and presents useful insights. Proper documentation of data sources and data transformations will give the users an understanding of the bias within data.
By adhering to the above ethics and inequity components SQL queries promote fairness and mitigate bias. This helps in data-driven decision making that benefits everyone.
